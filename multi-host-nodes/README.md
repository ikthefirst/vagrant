Multi-host Nodes

This example consist of 2 set of nodes. 
Each set of nodes will be executed on a different host. 
The nodes on each host will be connected via private network.
There will be one 'router' node on each host. 
The router nodes will have 2 network interfaces: (i) using public network (ii) connected to the private network of its host.
The routing tables of each node will be set up, so that nodes in separate private networks can reach each other via the 'router' nodes.
